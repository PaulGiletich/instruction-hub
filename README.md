npx instruction-hub config add owner/repo
npx instruction-hub config add https://ghe.company.com/company-org/company-copilot-instructions

npx instruction-hub update

# Uninstall instructions

## Authentication

### GitHub Enterprise & Private Repositories

For private repositories or GitHub Enterprise instances, you'll need to authenticate using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
brew install gh

# Authenticate with public GitHub
gh auth login

# Authenticate with GitHub Enterprise
gh auth login --hostname ghe.company.com

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

The tool automatically detects your authentication and uses the appropriate tokens for API requests.

### Supported Authentication Methods

- **GitHub CLI**: Automatically uses tokens from `gh auth` (recommended)
- **Public repositories**: No authentication required
- **Multiple instances**: Supports both public GitHub and enterprise instances simultaneously

## Configuration

Configuration is stored globally in `~/.instruction-hub/config.json` and includes:
- List of configured repositories

## Installation (Optional)

While the tool is designed to be used with `npx` or `bunx`, you can also install it globally if preferred:

```bash
npm install -g instruction-hub
# or
bun install -g instruction-hub
```
